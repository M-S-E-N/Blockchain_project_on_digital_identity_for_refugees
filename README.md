Refugee Identity Management System

Introduction
The Refugee Identity Management System is a software application designed to facilitate identity management for refugees and displaced persons.
It aims to provide a secure and efficient way to collect, store, and manage essential identity information, such as personal details, biometrics, and documentation.
In situations of displacement and humanitarian crises, individuals often lose access to their official documents, making it challenging to prove their identity.
This system aims to address this issue by offering a digital platform where refugees and aid organizations can securely manage identity-related data.

Features
User Registration: Refugees can register themselves in the system, providing basic personal information.
Biometric Data: The system supports the capture and storage of biometric data (e.g., fingerprints, facial recognition) for secure identification.
Document Upload: Users can upload important documents such as passports, birth certificates, and identification cards.
Authentication: Advanced authentication mechanisms ensure the security and privacy of user data.
Data Encryption: All data stored in the system is encrypted to protect sensitive information.
Access Control: Granular access controls ensure that only authorized personnel can access and update user data.
Data Retrieval: Aid organizations and government agencies can retrieve refugee data quickly when needed, improving service delivery.
